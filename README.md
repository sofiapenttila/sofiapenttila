# ASL-Lens
React object detection app using a custom object detection machine learning model hosted on IBM Cloud, built using Tensorflow.JS and OpenCV, to identify and live translate American Sign Language (ASL) to plain English

## Features 
ASL Lens can currently recognize 5 phrases: hello, yes, no, thank you, and I love you. The number assigned next to each box is the certainty of the estimations. The closer to 1, the more certain. The closer to 0, the more uncertain. 

ASL Lens can also identify two phrases simultaneously. Please see the last example for a demo!
